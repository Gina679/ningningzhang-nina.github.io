This is Zhang Ningning's personal homepage. Please also refer to my [homepage@UNSW](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/ze-jiang). 

## A short introduction
I am a Ph.D.

<b>Research Interests:</b>
* Causal inference
* Time series analysis

<b>Research Highlights:</b>
* Development of [spectral transformation](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR026962) and its [application](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126816) in hydro-climatology
