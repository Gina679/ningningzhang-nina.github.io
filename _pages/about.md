This is Zhang Ningning's personal homepage. Please also refer to my [homepage](ningningzhang-nina.github.io/). 

## A short introduction
I graduated from the University of Hong Kong with a PhD degree in December 2024. Before studying in HKU, I finished my bachelor and master education in Beijing Jiaotong Univeristy. 

<b>Research Interests:</b>
* Financial time series analysis
* Causal inference
* Machine learning
* Causal ML
* Spatial statistics
