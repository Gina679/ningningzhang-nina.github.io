I am an engineer, hydro-climatologist and researcher. My research focuses on drought detection and attribution, as well as prediction using GCM simulations. I mainly use statistical tools to carry out my research works. I am also an R enthusiast. 
More info about me can be found in [CV](https://ningningzhang-nina.github.io/cv/) or [downloaded CV](http://ningningzhang-nina.github.io/files/CV_CN.pdf).
