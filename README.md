## A short introduction
I am an statistical researcher. My research focuses on time series analysis, as well as causal inference. I mainly use statistical tools to carry out my research works.

PROFILE:
* Highly self-motivated researcher with demonstrated research expertise modeling hydro-climatology processes. 
* Strong interpersonal skills with a good sense of teamwork.
* Programming Skills: R, Matlab, and Python in both Unix and Windows environments.
